# Space-Invaders
[Under development]A simple game I made to learn python

*NOTE: You need to have pygame installed in order to play this game.*

To play the game, run spaceInvaders.py. Use the arrow keys to move the ship, space key to fire at aliens, and finally q to quit. Enjoy :)

This tutorial is based upon a pygame tutorial found in a book called "Python crash course". 

TO DO list:
1. Add a scoring system.
2. Add a "play again" button.
3. Add a starting screen(some sort of intro and a splash screen).
4. Add new aliens.
5. Allow the aliens to shoot.
6. Add shelters for the ship.
